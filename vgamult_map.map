      Number using O5 and O6:                  125
    Number used as Memory:                      17 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:            17
        Number using O6 output only:            17
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         3

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   179 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          451
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           204 out of     451   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  46 out of     451   10%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         201 out of     451   44%
    Number of unique control sets:              11
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       2 out of     148    1%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  2
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               2
    Total Memory used (KB):                     72 out of   5,328    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
